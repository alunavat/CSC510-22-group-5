|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |0|Can't find docs|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |0|Can't find docs|
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|0|Can't find docs|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|0|Can't find docs|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|0|Can't find docs|
